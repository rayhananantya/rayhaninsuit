- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rayhan Anantya (@rayhaninsuit)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence and so more. But I'm new here so I'm a total beginner in this field.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning meteorology in my campus (I know it has no relation on what I'm interested in--for instance)
- ğŸ“« First, I'm planning to take a look of how github works. But don't be hesitated once you wanna get to know me more. Just contact me via dm on twitter (@lalingling_) or email (rayhananantya@apps.ipb.ac.id).
